### 1. 
Task:

     Given 2 arrays: [1, 2, 3, 2, 0] and [5, 1, 2, 7, 3, 2]
     We need to return [1, 2, 2, 3] (the order is not important)

### 4. 
Task:

     The longest word
     For a given input string of words, create a function that returns the longest word in the string.
     For example, for the input phrase “I love Google.” the output should be “Google”.
     For an added challenge, you can create an output that lists the longest word along with the number of characters in the word.
     So, for the string “I love Google...” the output would look something like, “word: Google count: 6.”

### 5. 
Task:

     The FizzBuzz challenge is a popular problem in technical interviews.
     For a given maximum input value n, create a function that outputs integers from 1 to n.
     But, if an integer is divisible by three, then the number should be replaced with the word “Fizz.”
     Numbers divisible by five should say “Buzz” instead. And numbers divisible by both three and five should say “FizzBuzz.”
     For example, with an input of 17, the output should be:
     [1, 2 , ”Fizz”, 4, “Buzz”, “Fizz”, 7, 8, “Fizz“, “Buzz“, 11, “Fizz”, 13, 14, “FizzBuzz”, 16, 17]

### 6. 
Task:

     Steps
     For a given integer input n, create a function that returns a string output of generated steps using the # character.
     For example, for an input of 3, the output should look like:
     ‘#‘
     ‘##’
     ‘###’

### 7. 
Task:

     // Create an array of 15 integers
     // Enter values into it from the keyboard.
     // Let the array element index be the house number, and the value be the number of residents living in the house.
     // Houses with odd numbers are located at one Side of the Street, and houses with even numbers on the other.
     // Find out which side of the street has more residents.
     // Display the message: "Houses with odd numbers have more residents."
     // or "Houses with even numbers have more residents."
     // Note: a house with serial number 0 is considered even
