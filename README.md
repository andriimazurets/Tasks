### 4. 
Task:

     The longest word
     For a given input string of words, create a function that returns the longest word in the string.
     For example, for the input phrase “I love Google.” the output should be “Google”.
     For an added challenge, you can create an output that lists the longest word along with the number of characters in the word.
     So, for the string “I love Google...” the output would look something like, “word: Google count: 6.”

### 5. 
Task:

     The FizzBuzz challenge is a popular problem in technical interviews.
     For a given maximum input value n, create a function that outputs integers from 1 to n.
     But, if an integer is divisible by three, then the number should be replaced with the word “Fizz.”
     Numbers divisible by five should say “Buzz” instead. And numbers divisible by both three and five should say “FizzBuzz.”
     For example, with an input of 17, the output should be:
     [1, 2 , ”Fizz”, 4, “Buzz”, “Fizz”, 7, 8, “Fizz“, “Buzz“, 11, “Fizz”, 13, 14, “FizzBuzz”, 16, 17]
